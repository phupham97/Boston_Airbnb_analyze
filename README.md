# Boston_Airbnb_analyze
The analysis shows how Airbnb is utilized in Boston. I have analyzed Boston Airbnb listings from September 2016 to September 2027. The dataset reports the listing activities of homestays in Boston, including hosts info, prices, neighborhoods, amenities, cancellation policy, and reviews.
# Libraries
I imported pandas, numpy, matplotlib and multiple sklearn models.
# Questions
The analysis will try to help Boston hosts to set a reasonable rental price for their room, based on some question:
Question 1: Does locations of the house affect the price ?
Question 2: How prices for all Boston’s Airbnb fluctuate throughout the period 2016–2017 ?
Question 3: Which features will have high impact on prices ?
Question 4: Can we predict the rental price of new listings based on a model ?
